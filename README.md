# IMC2-Freedom
 The IMC2 Freedom client for IMC2 intermud networks.

This is the last known version of the IMC2 Freedom client to exist. It is being uploaded here purely for preservation purposes and will not be supported.

There are no surviving IMC2 networks online at this time and this protocol doesn't support TLS or any other secure communication method. Perhaps a project someone may be interested in?
